print(3+5)

# Write a print statement that uses the division operator /

# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *

# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it

length = 5

# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it

width = 6

# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`

area = length*width

# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable

print(f'The result is {area}')

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 

print(f'if the the width is {width} and the length is {length} then the area is {area}')
